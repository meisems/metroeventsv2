# Metro Events (Project MVP)

## Overview
Metro Events is a comprehensive Event Resource Management (ERM) system designed to streamline the event planning process. Originally developed for a software design laboratory project, this system provides event organizers with robust tools to manage clients, track event progress, and generate detailed estimates. 

The core philosophy of the application is a "One Event = One Workspace" logic, ensuring that all data, communications, and requirements for a specific event are centralized and isolated for maximum organization.

## Features
* **CRM Pipeline:** Track prospective clients and manage relationships seamlessly.
* **Quotation Builder:** Generate dynamic, customized cost estimates and quotations for events.
* **Dedicated Workspaces:** Isolated dashboards and management screens for every individual event.
* **Modular Design:** Built with a clean separation of routes, models, and templates.

## Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (rendered via Jinja2 templates)
* **Backend:** Python (Flask)
* **Database:** SQLAlchemy (PostgreSQL/SQLite), SQLite ('metro_events.db')

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

### Installation

# 1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/meisems/metroevents.git](https://github.com/meisems/metroevents.git)
   cd metroevents
   ```
# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```Bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

# 3. Install the dependencies:
```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# 4. Initialize the Database:
